This just demonstrates updating a battery after successfull login.
Keep in mind the related reports, eis-datasets or capacity-tests will not be changed, only the metadata. But they lose the reference to the battery.

```bash
  # install dependencies
  poetry install
  # install NovumApi
  pip install NovumApiClient
```
